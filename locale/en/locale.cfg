cubeplant-branch=A branch from a redleaf cubeplant. Can be further processed.
cubeplant-flower=A flower from a redleaf cubeplant. Can be planted to grow a new plant.

cubeslurry-filter=Filter. Used for filtering cubeplant slurry.
cubeslurry-filter-dirty=Dirty filter. Can be cleaned and reused.

cubeine-powder=Concentrated cubeine powder, has exceptional catalytic properties allowing it to boost speed of many machines.
cubeine-crystal=Crystalline form of cubeine, it's the essence of speed (because it's red). It has is even more potential amplifying machinery, use with care!

cubeine-powder-bag=A plastic bag containing 1000 units of cubeine powder
cubeine-crystal-bag=A plastic bag containing 100 units of cubeine crystals

cubeine-biochamber=A biochamber that has been modified to consume cubeine solution instead of nutrients. It seems quite happy enough.
cubeine-thruster=A thruster enhanced to use cubeine mixed fuel. Thrust has been massively increased at the cost of efficency.
